### What is Classic Traveller?

> Traveller (role-playing game)

> Traveller is a tabletop game where characters journey through star systems, engaging in exploration, ground and space battles, and interstellar trading. The game is influenced by various literary works and emphasizes commerce, sociological stratification, and a mix of low and high technology. The setting is centered around the human-dominated Third Imperium, a feudalistic interstellar empire. Despite the focus on humans, the Traveller universe is cosmopolitan and features various other sophont peoples. The game's history also features the Ancients, a highly advanced race that left behind ruins and artifacts scattered throughout the universe.

### What is this JAVA application for?

Traveller, in all it's forms, was / is somewhat notorious for the amount of administrative burden on the Games Master.  One of the common time sinks was the creation of unique worlds for the Player Characters to visit.

This JAVA-21 application is intended to reduce the creation of potential strange new worlds to visit to running the application in a terminal, and copy-pasting the resulting text output to your preferred game-management tool.
